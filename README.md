Welcome to my first Python Game.


-03/27/2020
Having only been in Zip Code Wilmington(A coding boot camp) for 3 Weeks utilizing my current understanding of classes(inheritance and methods), list(list comprehension, append, pop), control flow(for loops, while, if else, elif), indexing, and unit testing, and git. This is what I was able to come up with. I hope you enjoy and keep an eye out for version 2 as my skills progress.
